I am an engineer at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) working on virtualization technologies. In the past I have worked on performance modelling, memory systems, coherence, consistency and on-chip and off-chip interconnects. I have a PhD in Informatics from the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) where I worked on designing architectural support for systems with persistent memory.

My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bbs3A-8AAAAJ&hl=en).
